üìç About the Project - 
Developed in early 2023 as a 2nd-year BSIT project, this Android application was created after about one month of experience with Android Studio. It‚Äôs a bit messy, but still impressive for someone who barely knew what they were doing back then. All resources used were free, and the login and account creation features were implemented using Firebase Authentication.

üìç About the Application - 
Loksyon (short for Lokasyon Aksyon) is an Android application I developed for a school project. It aims to assist users , especially tourists or unfamiliar residents in quickly locating themselves and contacting emergency providers in the Digos City, Davao del Sur.

‚ú® Features - 
The application works offline after login and allows users to view their latitude and longitude directly on a map. It includes an option to copy the displayed location to the clipboard for quick use in text messages. A built-in directory provides contact details for key emergency providers in Digos City, such as the PNP, DPWH, hospitals, and fire department. Users can call or text these services directly through the app, and in urgent situations, send pre-filled emergency messages that automatically include their current coordinates.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Notes - 
The project was developed in Android Studio using Java and Kotlin, and integrates the Google Maps API for location mapping. It also utilizes Firebase Authentication for account creation and login. Internet access is required only during the login process, while all other features are fully functional offline. The application was created solely for educational purposes.
